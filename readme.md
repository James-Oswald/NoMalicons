**!!This project is depreciated and does not work with the current version of MAL!!**

Maintatining this to not break with each update to their CSS every month is too big a hastle, I surrender.

# No Malicons!

My custom edits to MAL's Styles

- Removes the annoying bright blue icons on the MAL seasonal page that make it hard to see your show status.
- Reverts the 1/8/22 changes where the status button is placed under the show card.
- Reverts the 2/1/22 changes of showing broadcast icons
